In this code, we first require the http module. Then, we define the API endpoint URL in the apiEndpoint variable. We use the http.get() function to make an HTTP GET request to the API endpoint.

Inside the callback function for the http.get() function, we define a data variable to store the data returned by the API. We then listen for the 'data' event on the response object, which is triggered whenever a chunk of data is received. We append each chunk of data to the data variable.

By initializing data with an empty string, we ensure that the += operator will concatenate new chunks of data to an empty string to form the complete data received from the API.

We also listen for the 'end' event on the response object, which is triggered when all the data has been received. Inside this event handler, we parse the JSON data in the data variable using JSON.parse() and log it to the console.

Finally, we handle any errors that occur during the HTTP request by listening for the 'error' event on the http.get() function and logging the error message to the console.
